Handel 1724

Bajazet 
emperor of defeated turks and prisoner of tamerlano 
Bajazet asks for daughters hand in marriage 
threatens to kill himself 
friend talks him out of it 
Conflict 
with only two sections doesnt allow for development, only recap / return to the last section 

transposing motifs 
different ornaments and intervals relate to the story and have different afflictions 

A section is syllabic 
use of tonic minor 
Section B needs to end in original key to go back to da capo (seciton a)
A section into B section is unprepared and not handled well to show conflict and sudden change 

expected in essays to compare to the john walter hills structure

harvard style referencing
