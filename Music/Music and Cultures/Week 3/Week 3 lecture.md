Cantata is more evolved madrigal 
more sections that return / [[Ritornelli]] (ritornello)
Writers  thought that the singers weren't adding musical ornaments and improvisations so they started writing in the ornaments to make sure they knew how to do it stylistically

# Florentine camerata NUMBER 1 
men scholars court musicians in 1580 to research discuss and experiment with greek musical concepts
	want to move the affections of the listener 
		Giovanni Bardi - noble sponsor
		Girolamo Mei - ancient greek expert
		Vincenzo Galilei - gallaleio gallaleis dad, experimental musician
		Giulio Caccini - credited the cameratas influence in LNM (Le Nuove Musiche) 
Gallaleio Gallalei was imprisoned because of the modern solar system around the sun not the earth which went against the church 

Vincenzo gallalei 
Ideal music 
- monophonic 
- Rhythms on spoken language 
- narrow range 
- greek tragedies 
- polyphony is not effective in moving the affections 

# Florentine camerata NUMBER 2
not as intelectual 
assembled to create theatrical genres in greek tragedy
practical needs for artistic entertainment at court 

Jacopo Corsi - nobleman funding these high profile court events 
Japopo Peri - famous singer and composer, caccinis rival 
Ottavio Rinuccini - poet and opera librettist 
Galilei participated sometimes 

used for entertainment and events 

Rivalry
Caccini tries to publish his work first but Jacopo peris was performed first

took pride in writing out their operas
they have two staves for the vocal line 
the aria is the basic shape or line for the voice 
there is a second stave for the improvised and ornamented line
the sheet music is precious and expensive to make to should look fancy

# Venitian Operas
commedia dell'arte, theatre companies performing at the courst 

Went to personal tutor here
