They love high voices (late 1500s)
The music at the [[Court of Ferrara]] is the meta.
In 1550 >, two vocal groups 

[[Castrati]] == [[ Concerto dei Castrati]]
[[Female Singers]] == [[Concerto delle Donne]]

Both of the groups had romantic relationships with the [[Patrons]] 
	Wives were for procreation and singers for pleasure

The [[Concerto delle Donne]] in the court were [[Laura Pevarera]], [[Liivia d'Arco]], [[Anna Guarini]],[[Tarquinia Molza]]
Married off to husbands to legitimise their presence at court
Very good at improvisation and sight reading
