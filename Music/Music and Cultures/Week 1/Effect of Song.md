Songs stimulate the senses and can have a "chain reaction"???
Song travels to the the body on a semi permeable breath. 
[[Permeable bodies]].

Process of consuming a song:

- The intellectual content goes to the brain
	- Thoughts are stored in the brain and impressions are made by the vibrations
- The emotional content of the song is transferred to the [[Spirit]]. Is also distributed to the [[Humors]].
	- The ratio of the [[Humors]] will be decided by the emotional content of the song.
