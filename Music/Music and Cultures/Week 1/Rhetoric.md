[[Rhetoric]] is the *systematic* *study of persuasive speaking and writing*
	Comes from ancient Roman civilisation
Writings of [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]] were prominent in 1600 

Not to be confused with being rhetorical which is not related at all

Linked to [[Oration]] and the [[Rules of Oratory]]
Most of the musicians at the time were well educated in these fields 
The rules helped people write music that would best move the affections (*emotions*) of the listener

The relationship between rhetoric and music changes in the baroque period
- **Early** baroque : *delivery*
- **Mid** baroque : *[[Musical Elocution]]*
- **Late** baroque : *invention*
