do the essay first
250 for both the intro and conclusion
leaves 1500 for 3 topics 
500 for each topic

topic questions are very broad so the scope needs to be brought down
need to include:

1. Primary sources 
2. The structure 
3. Lots of signposting 

do not define words concretely 
more about ideas and concepts than words definitions 
use the [Grove Music](https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic) dictionary not the oxford one

 draw in 
 thesis 
 organisation 
findings and further layout
